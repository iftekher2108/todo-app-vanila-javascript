# 📝 To-Do List App (Vanilla JavaScript + LocalStorage)

This is a simple, lightweight To-Do List web app built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. It allows users to add, view, and delete tasks using the browser's `localStorage`, so tasks persist even after refreshing or closing the browser tab.

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Add new tasks
- 📋 Display list of tasks on page load
- ❌ Delete individual tasks
- 💾 Stores all data in `localStorage`
- 🎨 Basic styling with custom CSS
- ⚡ Super lightweight (no frameworks)

## 💻 How It Works

- When the page loads, the app fetches tasks from `localStorage` (if any) and displays them.
- You can add a task using the input field.
- Tasks are displayed dynamically using JavaScript's `insertAdjacentHTML`.
- You can remove a task using the delete button next to each one.
- All data is stored in `localStorage` under the key `list_data`.
